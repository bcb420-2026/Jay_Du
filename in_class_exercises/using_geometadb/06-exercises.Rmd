# Exercises: Inspect Specific GEO Series

In this exercise, you'll retrieve metadata for the following GEO Series and answer:

**GSE IDs:** "GSE201427","GSE166530","GSE162183","GSE186458"

**Questions per GSE**

  1. **What type of data is it?  Describe it.** (platform technology; e.g., high-throughput sequencing, array)
  1. **What disease or model is it using?** (infer from series title/summary/platform organism)
  1. **How many samples are there? What type of data is associated with the record?** 
  1. **How many control and how many disease?** 
  1.  **Can you find out any information about the GEO dataset - GSE264108. Why or Why not?
  

> Hint: Sample labels are not standardized. Use robust keyword detection (e.g., `control|normal|healthy|wild[- ]?type` vs. `tumou?r|cancer|patient|disease|mutant|treated`). Inspect a few GSM rows if the automatic inference is uncertain.


**Summary of Findings per GSE:**

- **GSE201427**  
  - Type: High-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq)  
  - Organism/Disease: Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line (Panc1) under hypoxia. SF3B1 splicing factor knockdown was used to study its role in HIF1α-mediated gene expression and glycolysis.
  - Samples: 8 total (control vs SF3B1 knockdown)
  - Control vs Disease: 5 controls, 3 disease

- **GSE166530**  
  - Type: High-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq)   
  - Organism/Disease: Human COVID‑19 infection vs. control, focusing on transcriptional changes related to immune response and viral pathogenesis.
  - Samples: 41 total 
  - Control vs Disease: 5 controls, 36 disease

- **GSE162183**  
  - Type: Single‑cell expression profiling by high‑throughput sequencing (scRNA‑seq)
  - Organism/Disease: Human psoriasis. Lesional skin from psoriasis patients compared to healthy donor skin to identify immune and inflammatory cell populations.  
  - Samples: 6 (3 patients, 3 healthy donors) (scRNA‑seq)
  - Control vs Disease: 3 controls, 3 disease

- **GSE186458**  
  - Type: Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (DNA methylation)   
  - Organism/Disease: Healthy human tissues. Atlas of DNA methylation across 39 cell types to map epigenetic regulation; no disease model.  
  - Samples: 253 total
  - Control vs Disease: all 205 samples healthy

  **GSE264108**  
    No, not via GEOmetadb, because it is not present in the SQLite snapshot.
    However, it is available on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE264108)
